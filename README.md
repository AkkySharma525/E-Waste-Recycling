# 🌍 E-Waste Recycle - Trial Project for Hackathon Preparation

This was another project, **E-Waste Recycle**, was created as a trial to prepare for my first-ever hackathon at **IIT Guwahati**, where our team proudly secured the **1st Prize**! 🏆 This website serves as a prototype for e-waste management and recycling, showcasing my initial skills in **HTML** and **CSS**.

---

## 🚀 Overview
The **E-Waste Recycle** platform demonstrates the concept of simplifying e-waste management through:
- A single-page layout for smooth navigation.
- An eco-friendly **green-white theme** to reflect sustainability.
- Dynamic page transitions for an interactive user experience.

This project was a stepping stone that helped me gain confidence for hackathon participation and laid the foundation for my future projects.
